	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<hr>
	<p class="flow-text">
		I am a full-stack web developer, engineer and scientist. I have worked in scientific instrumentation, chemical analysis and software support for the last 18 years. When I am not tuning an ion-beam or troubleshooting a molecular separation, I am coding or spending time with my family.

		My hands-on experience includes building web apps, using APIs and persistent data, and providing IT support for laboratory software. I am knowledgeable in full-stack web development having just completed a 6-month coding bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill.

		I am also a gamer and amateur musician. I enjoy coding classic arcade games using Python, Node.js, JavaScript or in Unity3d. I mostly enjoy spending time with my wife, son and dog at the park on weekends.
